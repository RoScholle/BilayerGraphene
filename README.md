The Python file "SingleLayerGraphene.py" was used to create data for the plots of single layer graphene. One can simply change the parameters at the top to generate data for a given set of T,n,N_x,N_y,U etc. 
The same applies for Bernal Bilayer graphene and the code "BBG_MeanField.py".

The generated data from these files is available upon request from r.scholle@fkf.mpg.de. I am very glad for any requests or inquiries concerning the paper and happy to share the rawdata we collected for graphene or BBG.
