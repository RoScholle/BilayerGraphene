The codes and data presented here are not in a very readable style. Upon request, I would be glad to provide all relevant rawdata or processed data in the required format. I believe it is easier than to go through the code.

Otherwise: One can recreate the releant phase diagrams with the jupyter notebook "PhaseDiagram_BBG_Correct_Pixels_Github" or produce new data with the "BBG_MeanField" Python File.
