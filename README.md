The Python file "SingleLayerGraphene.py" was used to create data for the plots of single layer graphene. One can simply change the parameters at the top to generate data for a given set of T,n,N_x,N_y,U etc. 
The same applies for Bernal Bilayer graphene and the code "BernalBilayerGraphene.py".

The generated data from these files is available upon request from r.scholle@fkf.mpg.de. I am very glad for any requests or inquiries concerning the paper and happy to share the rawdata we collected for graphene or BBG.

If you want to recreate the phase diagrams, you can also click through the jupyter notebook. The generated data of BBG for U = 3 is already preprocessed and ready to be plotted.

We again highly encourage to directly contact us, since the code has not yet been made properly readable and accessible, but I would be glad to answer any possible questions for interested researchers.
